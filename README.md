# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Objectives

- Write basic JavaScript functions.
- Manipulate the DOM dynamically.
- Respond to user interactions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM. It includes functionality to change text content, toggle styles, and add new elements to the page in response to user interactions. The project is structured with semantic HTML5, styled with CSS, and powered by JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dynamic Text Content**: A button changes the text content of a paragraph dynamically.
- **Style Toggling**: A button toggles between light and dark modes using CSS classes.
- **Dynamic Element Addition**: A button adds new elements to the page dynamically.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-introduction-to-javascript-and-dom-manipulation-Collins101-dev.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd feb-2025-introduction-to-javascript-and-dom-manipulation-Collins101-dev
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## How It Works

- **Dynamic Text Content**: Clicking the "Change Text" button cycles through a predefined list of text options and updates the paragraph content dynamically.
- **Style Toggling**: Clicking the "Toggle Style" button toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element, switching between light and dark themes.
- **Dynamic Element Addition**: Clicking the "Add Element" button creates a new `<p>` element with styled text and appends it to the `<main>` section.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including light and dark themes.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamically manipulating the DOM.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity and DOM manipulation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
